        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p class="fds">In light of the siege that the Gaza Strip suffers from and the consequent interruption of face-to-face communication with the outside world, and the interruption of the cultural and artistic side’s access to the other side, from here the idea
            came to launch a commercial and cultural website on the Internet that revolves around the artistic cultural aspect in the Gaza Strip, It includes a number of artists in several fields to spread their talents such as drawing, photography, fashion
            design and embroideries to sell their paintings and works and spreads culture outside the country and Due to the limited local exhibitions in the Gaza Strip and the institutions that support the artistic cultural aspect due to many factors,
            the most important of which is the recent siege on the Gaza Strip and the limited artistic awareness of the groups of society as a whole. And because art today is one of the most powerful peaceful weapons that are used to spread cultures between
            countries, which Gaza lacks despite the need, we 8 had to work in a site that collects local artworks and presents them to other communities in the process of displaying Palestinian art well and stabilizing and unifying Palestinian artworks
            with all Its forms and times and will Facilitate linking people with limited talents in the artistic field with external institutions to support them and embrace them with job opportunities and their participation in external exhibitions and
            help them sell their paintings and artworks of various forms and times outside the country

                <p>Photography is one of the arts that embodies the beauty of the moment in which we live at its best, and while it does not need a lot of skills, it does require an understanding in order to take great pictures, such as understanding a number
                    of photography concepts such as lighting techniques, backgrounds, arrangements and so on, so when the picture is finished, the result will be a great shot. Practicing photography is another way to perfect your shots. The more practice
                    you get, the better your shots will be. Short courses can be taken to learn in detail to understand how to take photos so that they look natural and great. Photography develops the imaginative senses and the level of patience of those
                    who practice it, as it waits a long time in order to take a great and correct picture, and a good photographer will always look for good scenes or events to capture striking pictures, especially on happy occasions, I can say that I
                    just love to do photography, Whether you’re in the middle of landscapes or indoors amid walls. In Gaza there are many photographers who want to develop their talents and get jobs
